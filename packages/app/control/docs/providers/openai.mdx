# OpenAI Provider

The OpenAI provider gives you access to GPT models through the Vercel AI SDK with automatic Echo billing integration.

## Supported Models

All OpenAI models are supported via the `OpenAIModel` type:

<ModelTable path="../sdk/ts/src/supported-models/chat/openai.ts" />

## Additional Features

### Responses API Support

The OpenAI Responses API is fully supported through Echo's OpenAI provider.

```typescript
const result = streamText({
  model: openai.responses('gpt-5'),
  messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),
});
```

### Image Generation with GPT-image-1

Echo also supports OpenAI's image generation capabilities through the GPT-image-1 model:

```typescript
const result = await generateImage({
  model: openai.image('gpt-image-1'),
  prompt,
});
```

To instantiate `openai.responses` in these examples, see the following guides:
