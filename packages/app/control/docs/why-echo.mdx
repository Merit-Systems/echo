# Why Echo?

Echo is designed for indie developers and small teams building consumer AI apps who want to launch fast without fronting infrastructure costs.

## You Should Use Echo If:

- You're building a **consumer AI app** (chat, image generation, code tools)
- You want to **launch in minutes**, not weeks
- You're considering **BYOK** and want to streamline UX
- You **can't afford** to front $1K+/month in API costs
- You want **revenue from day one** with markup pricing
- Your users understand **pay-as-you-go** pricing

## You Probably Don't Need Echo If:

- You're building **enterprise B2B** (they expect seat-based pricing)
- You need **complex billing logic** beyond usage-based pricing
- You want to **subsidize AI costs** as a growth strategy
- You already have auth/billing infrastructure working well
