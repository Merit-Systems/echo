# Referrals (Beta)

User referrals allow you to incentivize users to market your application. Set a referral percentage (e.g., 5% of profit), and referrers earn that percentage on all profits generated by users they bring in for the lifetime of those users.

## How It Works

1. Enable referrals on your app with a percentage rate (e.g., 5%)
2. Users generate referral links to share your app
3. When someone signs up via a referral link, the referrer earns your set percentage on all profits from that user
4. Referral earnings are tracked and paid out alongside your regular earnings

## Example

With a 5% referral rate, if a referred user generates $100 in profit for your app, the referrer earns $5.
