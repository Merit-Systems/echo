# Markups & Fees

Echo charges **zero fees on costs**—only on your profit margin.

## How Markups Work

Set a markup percentage on your app (e.g., 20%). When users consume tokens, they pay:
- **Base cost** → Goes directly to the provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Your markup** → Your profit, held by Echo until claimed

**Example:** User spends $1.00 on tokens with 20% markup:
- $1.00 → Provider costs (you pay nothing)
- $0.20 → Your profit (Echo takes 2.5% = $0.005, you keep $0.195)

## Echo's Fee Structure

Echo takes a **2.5% fee on your profit only**—not on the base costs. This means:
- You never pay for provider costs
- You only share revenue when you make money
- No monthly fees or minimum charges
