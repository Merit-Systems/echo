# Claiming Earnings

## Setting Up Payouts

To receive payouts, associate a GitHub user or repository with your app in the [app settings](https://echo.merit.systems/apps).

Once configured, view pending earnings on the [creator earnings page](https://echo.merit.systems/earnings/creator).

## When Do Payouts Happen?

Claims are processed daily via [the Terminal](https://terminal.merit.systems). Funds are sent to the GitHub user or repository configured in your app settings at the time of payout.

**Important:** If no GitHub account is set, the transfer will be skipped that day. You can claim your funds through the Terminal once they're transferred.

For more information, see the [Terminal docs](https://www.merit.systems/docs/terminal).
