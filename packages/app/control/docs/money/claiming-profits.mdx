## Markups

Both Echo Apps and Users have strategies to monetize on Echo.

Apps earn a mark-up on each transaction, which is set by the app owner. This represents a percent upcharge on each token that passes through the application.

The mark-up earned can be claimed only when a Github user or repository has been associated with the app. This can be done in the app's settings page.
Once this is done, users can find their pending claims available on the [creator earnings page](https://echo.merit.systems/earnings/creator).

## Claims

Claims are processed on a daily basis and paid out via [the Terminal](https://terminal.merit.systems). The funds will be sent to the github User or Repository which is set on the Echo app
at the time of payout. If no Github account is set, the transfer will not be made on that day. You will be able to claim or redistribute your funds through the terminal once they are transferred.

For more information on the Terminal, please see the [docs](https://www.merit.systems/docs/terminal). 


## Referrals 

User referrals will allow app owners to incentivize users to market their application. App owners can agree to pay, for example, 5% of profit
to a referrer. Therefore, if a user signs up via a referral link, the creator of the referral link will earn 5% of all profits generated in the lifetime of the user. 

This feature is in early beta and may not work as expected. Please reach out in the [discord](https://discord.com/invite/JuKt7tPnNc) if you are interested in setting up referrals for your application.
