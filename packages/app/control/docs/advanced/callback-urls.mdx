# Authorized Callback URLs

Authorized callback URLs specify where users can be redirected after authentication. This is a critical security feature that prevents unauthorized redirects.

## Configuration

**Set your callback URL to your application's homepage URL.** This should be the deployed URL where your application is hosted in production.

Examples:
- `https://myapp.com`
- `https://myapp.vercel.app`
- `https://subdomain.mycompany.com`

## Development

**Localhost URLs are always allowed** for development purposes. You don't need to explicitly add localhost URLs to your authorized callback list.

## Next SDK Caveat

**Very important** - When productionizing your application with the Next SDK, you will need to append `/api/echo/callback` to your app's homepage route when inputting the correct authorized callback URL.

For example:
- If your app is hosted at `https://myapp.com`
- Set your authorized callback URL to `https://myapp.com/api/echo/callback`
