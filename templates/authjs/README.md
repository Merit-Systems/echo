# AuthJS + Echo Provider Template

A Next.js application demonstrating Echo as an Auth.js provider for authentication.

## Quick Start

Use the Echo CLI to create a new project with this template:

```bash
npx echo-start@latest --template authjs
```

You'll be prompted for your Echo App ID. Don't have one? Get it at [echo.merit.systems/new](https://echo.merit.systems/new).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
